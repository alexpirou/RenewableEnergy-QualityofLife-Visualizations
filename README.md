## Description 

In this project, we combined multiple datasets to create a series of visualization of global socioeconomic and environmental trends. We used three data sources, including the Regional Cost of Living Analysis, the World Bank’s Life Expectancy and Socioeconomic Dataset, and Global Renewable Energy Production Data. These datasets provided useful insights into six key indicators: renewable energy production, life expectancy, healthcare spending, CO₂ emissions, cost of living, and average income. The data spans multiple years, enabling temporal and spatial analyses of trends and correlations across countries.
